PolyCode Insight AI for Code Understanding and Documentation
A tool combining deep learning and symbolic reasoning to understand, explain, and generate code in multiple languages, analyze the code performance and provide efficient one , documentation for complex codebases, aiding developers in navigating and maintaining software projects.

in this app the user give input in one language like c then the ai convert the code into remaining languages the user want .and also provide the efficiency details of the code so that the user can able to pick the efficient code in terms of efficiency also[space and time complexity]and also there is another option where user can able to get the details like documentation , applications  [where the user use that code].
and it shows the testcases ,hidden testcases and also suggest cases that code should pass.


Interactive Code Querying
Enable developers to ask natural language questions about code functionality, dependencies, or logic flow, with the system providing clear, context-aware explanations.

Automated Code Refactoring Suggestions
Using symbolic reasoning combined with neural pattern recognition, provide suggestions for improving code quality, modularity, and performance.

Multi-Language Code Support
Support understanding and documenting codebases involving multiple programming languages or mixed-language projects seamlessly.

Explainable AI Decisions
Provide transparent explanations of how the AI derived conclusions about code behavior or documentation suggestions, enhancing developer trust.

Bug and Vulnerability Explanation
Identify potential bugs or security vulnerabilities and explain them in human-readable symbolic rules for easier debugging.
